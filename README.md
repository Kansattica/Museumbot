# Bluesky image poster bot

Automatic bluesky image poster bot, based on Bluesky's example code. You can see the account here: <https://bsky.app/profile/smmnh.bsky.social>.

Reads from `posts.csv` to know what images to associate with what posts. Expects its images to be in the `images` directory. Not all that exciting, honestly.
